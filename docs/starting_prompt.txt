I want to develop a OCR system for khmer text. But I want to start with a small prototype to validate the concept.

I want to start with the ocr for only khmer digits (០១២៣៤៥៦៧៨៩). each word will contains only 1 to 4 digits, randomly, without any extra signs. we'll use auto generating synthetic images for the training.

1. please introduce a viable model to prototype. write the description of the model in an .md file. 
2. create a workplan for the prototype development.


======================

The user wants to develop an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system for Khmer text, starting with a simple prototype focused on Khmer digits (០១២៣៤៥៦៧៨៩). They want:
1. Words containing 1-4 digits randomly
2. No extra signs
3. Synthetic image generation for training
4. A viable model description in an .md file
5. A workplan for prototype development

I should first explore the workspace to understand the current structure, then create a model description and workplan. Let me check the current directory structure first.

For the OCR model, I should consider:
- CNN-based approaches for digit recognition
- Sequence-to-sequence models for multi-digit recognition
- Transformer-based models

Simple classification approaches since we're dealing with a limited character set
Since this is a prototype for Khmer digits only (10 characters), I can suggest a relatively simple but effective approach.

Let me start by checking the workspace structure and then create the requested files.



======================================
please verify this @model_description.md if it's plausible? at the moment will train it to regconize images containing 1-4 digit images only (as a validating prototype). but make sure this model is applicable to expand to train for real khmer text. 


The user is asking me to verify the model description to ensure it's plausible for the current task (1-4 Khmer digits) and also extensible to full Khmer text recognition. Let me analyze the model architecture and technical specifications to check if they make sense.
Key things to verify:
Is the CNN-RNN hybrid architecture appropriate for OCR tasks?
Are the technical specifications realistic (image size, model parameters, etc.)?
Can this architecture scale to full Khmer text recognition?
Are there any issues with the proposed approach?
Let me think through each component:
CNN Backbone (ResNet-18/EfficientNet-B0): This is reasonable for feature extraction from images. ResNet-18 is a good choice for OCR tasks.
Sequence-to-Sequence with LSTM: This is appropriate for variable-length sequences. However, for just 1-4 digits, this might be overkill. A simpler CTC (Connectionist Temporal Classification) approach might be more appropriate.
Image Size (128x64): This seems reasonable for 1-4 digits, but might need adjustment for longer text sequences.
Model Parameters: ~13M parameters seems reasonable for this task.
Scalability to Full Khmer Text: This is the key question. The architecture should work for full text, but there are some considerations:
Character set will expand significantly (from 10 digits to 74+ characters including consonants, vowels, etc.)
Sequence length will need to increase significantly
Khmer script has complex rules for character combinations
Let me provide a detailed analysis.
