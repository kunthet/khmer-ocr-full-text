# 🚀 Enhanced Google Colab Training for Khmer OCR

## ✨ New Features

We've significantly enhanced the Colab training experience with these powerful features:

### 💾 Google Drive Integration
- **Automatic Save to Drive**: All models, checkpoints, and results saved directly to your Google Drive
- **No More Lost Progress**: Even if Colab disconnects, your progress is safe
- **Persistent Storage**: Access your models from any Colab session

### 🔄 Resumable Training  
- **Auto-Resume**: Automatically detects and resumes incomplete experiments
- **Checkpoint Recovery**: Resumes from exact epoch where training stopped
- **Smart Detection**: Identifies completed vs resumable experiments
- **State Preservation**: Optimizer, scheduler, and training history all preserved

### 🛡️ Crash Recovery
- **Disconnect Protection**: Training continues seamlessly after reconnection
- **Progress Tracking**: Always know exactly where each experiment left off
- **Data Integrity**: No corruption or loss of training state

### 📊 Enhanced Progress Tracking
- **Live Progress Bars**: Real-time visual progress for all experiments
- **Beautiful Results Tables**: Ranked results with detailed metrics
- **Experiment Status**: Clear indication of completed, running, and resumable experiments

## 🎯 Quick Start Guide

### Step 1: Setup (5 minutes)

```python
# 1. Enable GPU in Colab: Runtime → Change runtime type → GPU
# 2. Run this setup cell:

import torch
from google.colab import drive
import os

# Check GPU
print(f"GPU Available: {torch.cuda.is_available()}")
if torch.cuda.is_available():
    print(f"GPU: {torch.cuda.get_device_name(0)}")

# Mount Google Drive
drive.mount('/content/drive')

# Install dependencies
!pip install -q opencv-python-headless albumentations tensorboard efficientnet-pytorch Pillow pyyaml tqdm

print("✅ Setup complete!")
```

### Step 2: Upload Project

```python
# Upload your project ZIP file
from google.colab import files
import zipfile

uploaded = files.upload()
for filename in uploaded.keys():
    if filename.endswith('.zip'):
        with zipfile.ZipFile(filename, 'r') as zip_ref:
            zip_ref.extractall('.')

# Setup paths
import sys
from pathlib import Path

project_root = Path('./khmer-ocr-digits').resolve()  # Adjust if needed
os.chdir(project_root)
sys.path.append(str(project_root / 'src'))

print(f"✅ Project ready: {project_root}")
```

### Step 3: Run Enhanced Training

```python
# Load the enhanced trainer
exec(open('src/sample_scripts/enhanced_colab_trainer.py').read())

# Setup Google Drive integration
models_path, results_path = setup_drive_integration()

# Initialize enhanced tuner with Drive support
tuner = EnhancedColabHyperparameterTuner(
    drive_models_path=models_path,
    drive_results_path=results_path,
    auto_resume=True  # Automatically resume incomplete experiments
)

# Run experiments - they will auto-resume if interrupted!
tuner.run_experiments()

# Save results to Drive
results_file = tuner.save_results()
print(f"Results saved to: {results_file}")
```

## 🔄 Resume Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Colab Disconnected During Training
```python
# Simply re-run the enhanced trainer setup:
exec(open('src/sample_scripts/enhanced_colab_trainer.py').read())
models_path, results_path = setup_drive_integration()

tuner = EnhancedColabHyperparameterTuner(
    drive_models_path=models_path,
    drive_results_path=results_path
)

# It will automatically detect and resume incomplete experiments
tuner.run_experiments()
```

### Scenario 2: Run Specific Experiments Only
```python
# Run only certain experiments
tuner.run_experiments(['conservative_small', 'baseline_optimized'])
```

### Scenario 3: Check Progress Without Training
```python
# Just check what experiments exist
tuner = EnhancedColabHyperparameterTuner(
    drive_models_path=models_path,
    drive_results_path=results_path
)
# Will display table of existing experiments automatically
```

## 📊 Expected Performance Improvements

### Training Speed
- **GPU Acceleration**: ~10x faster than CPU training
- **Mixed Precision**: Additional 1.5-2x speedup on compatible GPUs
- **Optimized Data Loading**: Reduced I/O bottlenecks

### Time Estimates (with GPU)
| Experiment | CPU Time | GPU Time | Status |
|------------|----------|----------|--------|
| conservative_small | 45 min | 4-5 min | ✅ |
| baseline_optimized | 60 min | 6-7 min | ✅ |
| All 7 experiments | 6-8 hours | 45-60 min | ✅ |

### Expected Accuracy Improvements
- **Current (CPU, 2 epochs)**: ~31% character accuracy
- **Expected (GPU, full training)**: 45-60% character accuracy
- **Target**: 85% character accuracy, 70% sequence accuracy

## 🗂️ Drive Folder Structure

Your Google Drive will have this structure:
```
📁 MyDrive/Khmer_OCR_Experiments/
├── 📁 training_output/
│   ├── 📁 conservative_small/
│   │   ├── 📁 checkpoints/
│   │   │   ├── best_model.pth
│   │   │   ├── latest_model.pth
│   │   │   └── checkpoint_epoch_*.pth

```

## 🆚 Comparison: Basic vs Enhanced

| Feature | Basic Notebook | Enhanced Script |
|---------|---------------|-----------------|
| **Storage** | Local (lost on disconnect) | Google Drive (persistent) |
| **Resume** | ❌ Start from scratch | ✅ Auto-resume from checkpoint |
| **Progress Tracking** | Basic logs | ✅ Live HTML progress bars |
| **Crash Recovery** | ❌ All progress lost | ✅ No progress lost |
| **Results Management** | Manual | ✅ Automatic save to Drive |
| **Multi-session** | ❌ Can't continue | ✅ Continue across sessions |
| **GPU Optimization** | Basic | ✅ Fully optimized |

## 🔧 Configuration Options

### Drive Paths (Customizable)
```python
# Default paths:
DRIVE_ROOT = '/content/drive/MyDrive'
PROJECT_DRIVE_PATH = f'{DRIVE_ROOT}/Khmer_OCR_Experiments'
MODELS_DRIVE_PATH = f'{PROJECT_DRIVE_PATH}/training_output'
RESULTS_DRIVE_PATH = f'{PROJECT_DRIVE_PATH}/results'

# Custom paths:
tuner = EnhancedColabHyperparameterTuner(
    drive_models_path='/content/drive/MyDrive/MyCustomPath/models',
    drive_results_path='/content/drive/MyDrive/MyCustomPath/results'
)
```

### Training Parameters
```python
# Enhanced config supports all original parameters plus:
config = EnhancedTrainingConfig(
    # Original parameters...
    experiment_name="my_experiment",
    num_epochs=50,
    batch_size=32,
    learning_rate=0.001,
    
    # Enhanced parameters:
    resume_from_checkpoint="/path/to/checkpoint.pth",  # Manual resume
    drive_output_dir="/content/drive/MyDrive/models",  # Drive path
    auto_resume=True  # Automatic resume detection
)
```

## 🚨 Important Notes

### Before Starting
1. **Enable GPU**: Runtime → Change runtime type → GPU (T4 recommended)
2. **Authorize Drive**: You'll need to authorize Google Drive access
3. **Check Storage**: Ensure you have enough Drive space (~2-5GB for all experiments)

### During Training
- **Don't close the browser tab** unless you want to test resume functionality
- **Monitor GPU usage** in Colab's resource monitor
- **Results are auto-saved** every few epochs to Drive

### After Training
- **Download results** from Drive if needed
- **Share Drive folder** with collaborators for easy access
- **Use TensorBoard** for detailed training visualization

## ❓ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Import Error"**
```python
# Solution: Check project structure and paths
import os
print("Current directory:", os.getcwd())
print("Contents:", os.listdir('.'))
```

**"Drive Mount Failed"**
```python
# Solution: Re-authorize Drive
from google.colab import drive
drive.mount('/content/drive', force_remount=True)
```

**"GPU Not Available"**
```python
# Solution: Enable GPU in Runtime settings
import torch
print(f"CUDA available: {torch.cuda.is_available()}")
# If False, go to Runtime → Change runtime type → GPU
```

**"Resume Not Working"**
```python
# Solution: Check checkpoint files exist
import glob
checkpoints = glob.glob('/content/drive/MyDrive/Khmer_OCR_Experiments/training_output/*/checkpoints/*.pth')
print(f"Found {len(checkpoints)} checkpoints")
```
